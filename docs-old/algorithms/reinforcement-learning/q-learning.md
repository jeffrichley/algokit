!!! abstract "Overview"
    Q-Learning is a model-free, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function (Q-function) for a Markov Decision Process (MDP). It's one of the most fundamental and widely-used algorithms in reinforcement learning, capable of learning optimal policies without requiring a model of the environment.

    The algorithm works by iteratively updating Q-values based on the Bellman equation, using temporal difference learning to estimate the expected future rewards. Q-Learning is particularly powerful because it can learn optimal policies even when taking random actions during training, making it suitable for exploration-heavy scenarios.

## Mathematical Formulation

!!! math "Q-Learning Update Rule"
    The core Q-Learning update rule follows the Bellman optimality equation:

    $$Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha \left[ r_t + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a') - Q(s_t, a_t) \right]$$

    Where:
    - $Q(s, a)$ is the Q-value for state $s$ and action $a$
    - $\alpha$ is the learning rate (controls update magnitude)
    - $r_t$ is the immediate reward at time $t$
    - $\gamma$ is the discount factor (future reward importance)
    - $\max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a')$ is the maximum Q-value for the next state

!!! success "Key Properties"
    - **Model-Free**: Doesn't require knowledge of environment dynamics
    - **Off-Policy**: Can learn optimal policy while following different behavior policy
    - **Temporal Difference**: Updates estimates based on difference between predicted and actual values
    - **Convergence**: Guaranteed to converge to optimal Q-values under certain conditions
