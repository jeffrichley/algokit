# Gaussian Process Algorithms

## Overview
Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful framework for probabilistic machine learning that provides a principled approach to uncertainty quantification. GPs model functions as distributions over functions, making them ideal for regression, classification, and optimization tasks where uncertainty estimates are crucial. They excel in scenarios with limited data and provide interpretable results.

## Key Concepts
- **Kernel Functions**: Define similarity between data points and determine GP behavior
- **Prior Distribution**: Initial beliefs about the function before seeing data
- **Posterior Distribution**: Updated beliefs after observing data
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Natural confidence intervals for predictions
- **Non-parametric**: Model complexity grows with data size
- **Bayesian Inference**: Incorporates prior knowledge and updates beliefs
