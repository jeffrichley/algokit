description: |
  Robust Control is a comprehensive control design methodology that ensures system stability and performance despite model uncertainties, parameter variations, and external disturbances. Unlike traditional control methods that assume perfect knowledge of system parameters, robust controllers are designed to handle bounded uncertainties while maintaining desired closed-loop behavior.

  This approach is essential in applications where system parameters are uncertain, operating conditions vary significantly, or when safety and reliability are critical. Robust control methods include H-infinity control, μ-synthesis, structured singular value analysis, and various uncertainty modeling techniques that provide guaranteed performance bounds.

# Problem formulation and mathematical details
formulation:
  uncertain_system: |
    The uncertain system is described by:

    ẋ(t) = (A + ΔA)x(t) + (B + ΔB)u(t) + (E + ΔE)w(t)

    Where:
    - x(t) is the state vector
    - u(t) is the control input
    - w(t) is the disturbance input
    - ΔA, ΔB, ΔE are uncertainty matrices

  uncertainty_bounds: |
    The uncertainties are bounded by:

    ||ΔA|| ≤ α, ||ΔB|| ≤ β, ||ΔE|| ≤ γ

    Where α, β, γ are known bounds.

  robust_stability: |
    The system is robustly stable if:

    max_Δ max_i Re(λ_i(A + ΔA + (B + ΔB)K)) < 0

    For all admissible uncertainties Δ.

  robust_performance: |
    Robust performance is achieved when:

    sup_Δ ||T_zw(s, Δ)||_∞ < γ

    Where T_zw(s, Δ) is the closed-loop transfer function under uncertainty.
