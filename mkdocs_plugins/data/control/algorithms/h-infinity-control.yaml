description: |
  H-Infinity Control is a robust control design methodology that minimizes the worst-case performance of a system under bounded disturbances and uncertainties. The controller is designed to minimize the H-infinity norm of the closed-loop transfer function from disturbances to performance outputs, ensuring robust performance across a wide range of operating conditions.

  This approach is particularly valuable in aerospace applications, automotive systems, power electronics, and other domains where system performance must be guaranteed despite parameter variations, external disturbances, and model uncertainties. H-infinity controllers provide excellent robustness properties and are widely used in safety-critical applications.

# Problem formulation and mathematical details
formulation:
  generalized_plant: |
    The generalized plant P(s) is described by:

    [z]   [P₁₁(s) P₁₂(s)] [w]
    [y] = [P₂₁(s) P₂₂(s)] [u]

    Where:
    - w is the exogenous input (disturbances, reference signals)
    - u is the control input
    - z is the performance output
    - y is the measured output

  h_infinity_norm: |
    The H-infinity norm of a transfer function G(s) is:

    ||G(s)||_∞ = sup_{ω ∈ ℝ} σ_max(G(jω))

    Where σ_max denotes the maximum singular value.

  control_problem: |
    Find a stabilizing controller K(s) such that:

    min_{K(s)} ||T_zw(s)||_∞ < γ

    Where T_zw(s) is the closed-loop transfer function from w to z.

  riccati_equations: |
    The H-infinity controller is obtained by solving the coupled Riccati equations:

    A^T X + X A + X (γ⁻² B₁ B₁^T - B₂ B₂^T) X + C₁^T C₁ = 0
    A Y + Y A^T + Y (γ⁻² C₁^T C₁ - C₂^T C₂) Y + B₁ B₁^T = 0

    Where X and Y are the stabilizing solutions.
