summary: "Robust control strategy that forces the system state to reach and remain on a predefined sliding surface, regardless of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances."

# Detailed description (markdown supported) - full overview for the algorithm page
description: |
  Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is a robust control strategy that forces the system state to reach and remain on a predefined sliding surface, regardless of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. The controller switches between different control structures based on the system's position relative to this surface, creating a discontinuous control law that provides excellent robustness properties.

  This approach is particularly valuable in applications where system parameters are uncertain, external disturbances are present, or when high-precision control is required. Sliding mode controllers are widely used in aerospace systems, robotics, power electronics, and other domains where robustness is critical.

# Problem formulation and mathematical details
formulation:
  sliding_surface: |
    The sliding surface s(x,t) is defined as:

    s(x,t) = (d/dt + λ)^{n-1} e(t)

    Where:
    - e(t) = x_d(t) - x(t) is the tracking error
    - x_d(t) is the desired trajectory
    - x(t) is the current state
    - λ > 0 is a design parameter
    - n is the system order

  sliding_condition: |
    The sliding mode occurs when s(x,t) = 0, which implies:

    ṡ(x,t) = 0

  control_law: |
    The control input u(t) consists of two components:

    u(t) = u_eq(t) + u_sw(t)

    Where:
    - u_eq(t) is the equivalent control (continuous part)
    - u_sw(t) is the switching control (discontinuous part)

  equivalent_control: |
    u_eq(t) = -B^{-1}(x) [f(x) + λ ė(t)]

  switching_control: |
    u_sw(t) = -K sign(s(x,t))

    Where K > 0 is the switching gain and sign(·) is the signum function.
