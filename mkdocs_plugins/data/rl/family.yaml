  Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions
  by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions
  and learns to maximize cumulative reward over time through trial and error.

  Unlike supervised learning, RL doesn't require labeled training data. Instead, the agent learns
  through exploration and exploitation, discovering optimal policies through interaction with the
  environment. This makes RL particularly powerful for sequential decision-making problems where
  the consequences of actions unfold over time.

# Implementation and development status
# Note: status is inferred from algorithm statuses in the algorithms/ directory
# Status levels: "planned" -> "in-progress" -> "complete"
# Family status = "complete" if all algorithms are complete, "in-progress" if any are in-progress, "planned" if all are planned

# Performance and complexity information
complexity:
  typical_time: "O(|S|²|A|) to O(|S||A|)"
  typical_space: "O(|S||A|) to O(|S|)"
  notes: "Complexity depends on state space size |S|, action space size |A|, and algorithm choice"

# Domain-specific sections (can be customized per family)

      !!! info "Model-Based vs Model-Free"

          **Model-Based RL**:

          - Learn a model of the environment
          - Use the model to plan optimal actions
          - More sample efficient
          - Requires accurate environment modeling

          **Model-Free RL**:

          - Learn directly from experience
          - No explicit environment model
          - More robust to model errors
          - May require more samples

  - name: "Value vs Policy Methods"
    content: |
      !!! info "Learning Approaches"

          1. **Value-Based**: Learn value functions, derive policy (Q-Learning, SARSA)
          2. **Policy-Based**: Learn policy directly (REINFORCE, Policy Gradient)
          3. **Actor-Critic**: Combine value and policy learning
          4. **Model-Based**: Learn environment model, plan with it
