# Detailed description (markdown supported) - full overview for the algorithm page
description: |
  Linear MPC is a specialized form of Model Predictive Control that applies to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. By leveraging the linearity of the system, Linear MPC can be formulated as a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem, which can be solved efficiently using specialized optimization algorithms.

  This approach provides excellent performance for linear systems while maintaining the predictive and constraint-handling capabilities of MPC. Linear MPC is widely used in industrial process control, automotive applications, and aerospace systems where the system dynamics can be well-approximated by linear models. The QP formulation enables real-time implementation and provides theoretical guarantees for stability and performance.

# Problem formulation and mathematical details
formulation:
  control_law: |
    For linear system: x(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k), y(k) = Cx(k)
    
    The QP formulation is:
    
    min_{U_k} (1/2) U_k^T H U_k + f^T U_k
    
    Subject to:
    - G U_k ≤ w
    - A_eq U_k = b_eq
    
    Where:
    - H = Γ^T Q̄ Γ + R̄ is the Hessian matrix
    - f = Γ^T Q̄ (Φ x(k) - R_k) is the gradient
    - Q̄ = diag(Q, Q, ..., Q, Q_f) and R̄ = diag(R, R, ..., R)
    - R_k is the reference trajectory
    - Φ, Γ are prediction matrices

  discrete_time_form: |
    State prediction over horizon N_p:
    
    X_k = Φ x(k) + Γ U_k
    
    Where:
    - X_k = [x(k+1|k), x(k+2|k), ..., x(k+N_p|k)]^T
    - U_k = [u(k), u(k+1), ..., u(k+N_c-1)]^T
    - Φ, Γ are prediction matrices built from A, B
