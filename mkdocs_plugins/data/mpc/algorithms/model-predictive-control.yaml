summary: "Advanced control strategy that uses system models to predict future behavior and optimize control actions over a finite horizon while handling constraints."

# Detailed description (markdown supported) - full overview for the algorithm page
description: |
  Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an advanced control strategy that uses a mathematical model of the system to predict future behavior and optimize control actions over a finite prediction horizon. Unlike traditional control methods, MPC explicitly handles constraints on inputs, outputs, and states while optimizing a performance objective.

  The key principle of MPC is the receding horizon approach: at each time step, the controller solves an optimization problem over a finite prediction horizon, implements only the first control action, and then shifts the horizon forward by one time step. This approach provides excellent performance for complex systems with constraints and is widely used in process industries, automotive, aerospace, and robotics applications.

# Problem formulation and mathematical details
formulation:
  control_law: |
    At each time step k, solve:
    
    min_{U_k} J(x(k), U_k) = Σ_{i=0}^{N_p-1} ||y(k+i|k) - r(k+i)||_Q² + Σ_{i=0}^{N_c-1} ||u(k+i)||_R²
    
    Subject to:
    - x(k+i+1|k) = f(x(k+i|k), u(k+i), d(k+i))
    - y(k+i|k) = h(x(k+i|k), u(k+i))
    - g(x(k+i|k), u(k+i)) ≤ 0
    - u_min ≤ u(k+i) ≤ u_max
    - x_min ≤ x(k+i|k) ≤ x_max
    
    Where:
    - U_k = [u(k), u(k+1), ..., u(k+N_c-1)] is the control sequence
    - N_p is the prediction horizon
    - N_c is the control horizon
    - r(k) is the reference trajectory
    - Q and R are weighting matrices

  discrete_time_form: |
    The receding horizon implementation:
    
    1. Measure current state x(k)
    2. Solve optimization problem for U_k
    3. Apply first control action u(k) = U_k[0]
    4. Shift horizon: k ← k+1
    5. Repeat
