  Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic paradigm that solves complex
  problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. The key insight is that
  many problems have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, allowing us
  to store and reuse solutions to avoid redundant computation.

  Dynamic Programming is one of the most important algorithmic paradigms in computer science.
  It provides an elegant way to solve optimization problems by storing solutions to
  subproblems and reusing them, avoiding the exponential time complexity of naive
  recursive approaches.

          **Memoization (Top-Down)**:

          - Natural recursive approach
          - Only computes needed subproblems
          - Can be memory efficient
          - May cause stack overflow for deep recursion

          **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**:

          - Iterative approach
          - Computes all subproblems
          - Better space optimization possible
          - No recursion stack issues

  - name: "Common Patterns"

      !!! info "DP Problem Patterns"

          1. **1D DP**: Single dimension state (Fibonacci, climbing stairs)
          2. **2D DP**: Two dimensions (LCS, edit distance)
          3. **Interval DP**: Working with intervals (matrix chain multiplication)
          4. **Tree DP**: On tree structures
          5. **Digit DP**: On digit sequences
