# Detailed description (markdown supported) - full overview for the algorithm page
description: |
  The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a fundamental dynamic programming problem
  that finds the longest subsequence present in both given sequences. A subsequence is a sequence
  that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

  This algorithm has wide applications in bioinformatics (DNA sequence alignment), version control
  systems (diff algorithms), and text processing (plagiarism detection).

# Problem formulation
formulation:
  problem_definition: |
    Given two sequences X = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₘ] and Y = [y₁, y₂, ..., yₙ], find the longest
    subsequence that appears in both sequences.
  recurrence_relation: |
    LCS(i,j) = {
      0,                           if i = 0 or j = 0
      1 + LCS(i-1, j-1),          if xᵢ = yⱼ
      max(LCS(i-1, j), LCS(i, j-1)), otherwise
    }
