  The Fibonacci sequence is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that demonstrates the power of dynamic programming.
  The sequence is defined as: each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.
  The sequence begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

  While this can be solved with simple recursion, the naive approach has exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations.
  Dynamic programming provides an elegant solution that reduces this to linear time complexity.
