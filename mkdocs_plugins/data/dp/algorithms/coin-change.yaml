  The Coin Change problem is a classic dynamic programming challenge that asks: given a set of coin denominations
  and a target amount, what is the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount? This problem demonstrates
  the power of dynamic programming in solving optimization problems with overlapping subproblems.

  While a greedy approach might work for some coin sets (like US coins), it fails for arbitrary denominations.
  Dynamic programming provides an elegant solution that guarantees the optimal result by building solutions from
  smaller subproblems.

# Problem formulation and mathematical details

    Given:
    - A set of coin denominations: C = {c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ}

    Find the minimum number of coins needed to make amount A:

    min Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ xᵢ subject to Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ cᵢxᵢ = A

    Where xᵢ represents the number of coins of denomination cᵢ.
