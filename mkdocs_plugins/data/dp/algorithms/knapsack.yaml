  The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a fundamental optimization problem in computer science. Given a set of items,
  each with a weight and value, determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting items such that
  the total weight does not exceed a given capacity.

  This problem is a classic example of dynamic programming and has applications in resource allocation,
  portfolio optimization, and cutting stock problems.
