  The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a fundamental optimization problem in computer science. Given a set of items, 
  each with a weight and value, determine the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting items such that 
  the total weight does not exceed a given capacity.
  
  This problem is a classic example of dynamic programming and has applications in resource allocation, 
  portfolio optimization, and cutting stock problems.
