description: |
  Deep Gaussian Processes (Deep GPs) extend traditional Gaussian processes by stacking multiple GP layers
  in a hierarchical fashion, similar to deep neural networks. Each layer transforms the input through a
  Gaussian process, creating a composition of functions that can model complex, non-stationary relationships.

  The key advantage is the ability to learn hierarchical representations and handle non-stationary data
  while maintaining the uncertainty quantification properties of standard GPs. However, this comes at the
  cost of increased computational complexity and the need for approximate inference methods.
