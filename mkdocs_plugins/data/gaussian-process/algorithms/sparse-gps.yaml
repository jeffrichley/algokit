description: |
  Sparse Gaussian Processes address the scalability limitations of standard GPs by introducing a set of
  inducing points (also called pseudo-inputs) that act as a compressed representation of the training data.
  This reduces the computational complexity from O(n³) to O(nm²) where m << n is the number of inducing points.

  The key insight is that the full training data can be approximated using a smaller set of representative
  points, making GPs applicable to large-scale problems while maintaining most of their predictive power
  and uncertainty quantification capabilities.
