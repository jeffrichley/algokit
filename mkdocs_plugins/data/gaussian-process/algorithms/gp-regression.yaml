  Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a powerful non-parametric Bayesian method for regression that provides
  both predictions and uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional regression methods, GPR doesn't assume a
  specific functional form but instead places a prior over functions and updates this prior based on observed data.

  The key advantage of GPR is its ability to quantify uncertainty in predictions, making it particularly
  valuable for applications where understanding prediction confidence is crucial, such as active learning,
  experimental design, and safety-critical systems.
