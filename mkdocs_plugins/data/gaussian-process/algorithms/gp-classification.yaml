  Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) extends the principles of Gaussian Process Regression to classification problems.
  Unlike regression, classification requires mapping the continuous GP output to discrete class labels through a link function,
  typically the sigmoid function for binary classification or softmax for multi-class problems.

  The key challenge in GP classification is that the posterior distribution is no longer Gaussian due to the non-linear
  link function, requiring approximate inference methods such as Laplace approximation or variational inference.
