summary: "Planning algorithm that maintains partial ordering of actions, allowing flexible execution order and handling of uncertain environments."

# Detailed description (markdown supported) - full overview for the algorithm page

  Partial Order Planning (POP) is a classical planning algorithm that maintains a partial ordering of actions
  rather than a strict sequence. This approach allows for flexible execution order and can handle uncertain
  environments where the exact order of actions may not be known in advance.

  The key insight is that many planning problems don't require a strict sequence of actions - only that
  certain actions must occur before others. This flexibility makes POP particularly useful for problems
  involving parallel execution, resource constraints, and uncertain environments.
