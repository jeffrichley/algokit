description: |
  M* is a multi-agent pathfinding algorithm that extends A* search to handle multiple agents simultaneously.
  The algorithm finds collision-free paths for multiple agents by detecting conflicts between their planned
  paths and resolving them through coordination and replanning.

  The key insight is that agents can plan their paths independently initially, but when conflicts arise
  (agents occupying the same location at the same time), the algorithm expands the search space to
  include coordinated movements that resolve these conflicts.
