# HIRO Implementation Improvements

## Overview

This document tracks the improvements made to the HIRO (Data-Efficient Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning) implementation to ensure correctness and alignment with the original paper (Nachum et al., 2018).

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. Goal Representation as State Deltas
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Issue:** Original implementation used absolute state coordinates as goals.

**Fix:** Goals are now represented as state deltas (relative displacements): `g = s_{t+k} - s_t`
- Higher-level policy proposes relative displacement goals
- Lower-level policy learns to achieve these relative goals
- Intrinsic rewards compare achieved displacement vs. target displacement

**Impact:** Critical for correct HIRO behavior - enables proper goal relabeling and hierarchical learning.

---

### 2. Goal Relabeling with Hindsight
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Issue:** Goal relabeling was not using true hindsight correction.

**Fix:** Implemented proper hindsight relabeling using achieved state deltas:
```python
def relabel_goal(start_state, trajectory, horizon):
    achieved_state = trajectory[horizon - 1] if len(trajectory) >= horizon else trajectory[-1]
    return achieved_state - start_state  # Return delta, not absolute position
```

**Impact:** Enables efficient off-policy learning and data reuse.

---

### 3. Intrinsic Reward Normalization
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Issue:** Intrinsic rewards could dominate extrinsic rewards, causing instability.

**Fix:** Implemented running mean/std normalization and scaling:
- Track distance statistics in rolling buffer (10,000 samples)
- Normalize by running mean and standard deviation
- Scale by state dimensionality: `scaled_reward = -normalized_dist * scale / sqrt(state_size)`

**Impact:** Prevents intrinsic rewards from overwhelming extrinsic rewards, improves training stability.

---

### 4. TD3-Style Target Policy Smoothing
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Issue:** Higher-level policy updates lacked noise regularization.

**Fix:** Added target policy smoothing for higher-level critic updates:
```python
# Add clipped Gaussian noise to target policy actions
noise = torch.randn_like(next_goals) * policy_noise
noise = torch.clamp(noise, -noise_clip, noise_clip)
next_goals_noisy = next_goals + noise
```

**Impact:** Improves robustness and stability of higher-level policy learning.

---

### 5. Diverse Experience Sampling
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Issue:** Uniform random sampling could lead to biased training.

**Fix:** Implemented diverse sampling strategy:
- 50% from recent experiences (last 20% of buffer)
- 50% from entire buffer (diverse sampling)
- Ensures balanced training across near and far subgoals

**Impact:** Better exploration and more stable learning across different goal distances.

---

### 6. Proper Q-Value Computation
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Issue:** Critics were not properly using (s, g, a) tuples.

**Fix:**
- Higher-level critic: Uses (state, goal) pairs
- Lower-level critic: Uses (state, goal, action) triples
- Both critics properly integrated into value estimation

**Impact:** Correct value function learning for hierarchical policies.

---

### 7. **NEW** Explicit Actor Updates with Deterministic Policy Gradient
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Just Added!)

**Issue:** Only critics were being trained; no explicit policy improvement step.

**Fix:** Added separate actor update methods for both levels:

#### Higher-Level Actor Update
```python
def train_higher_actor(batch_size=64):
    goals = higher_policy(states)
    q_value = higher_policy.get_value(states, goals)
    actor_loss = -q_value.mean()  # Maximize Q-value
    # Gradient ascent on expected return
```

#### Lower-Level Actor Update
```python
def train_lower_actor(batch_size=64):
    logits = lower_policy(states, goals)
    probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
    # Compute expected Q-value over action distribution
    expected_q = (probs * q_values).sum(dim=1)
    actor_loss = -expected_q.mean()  # Maximize expected Q-value
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Separate optimizers for actors and critics
- Delayed policy updates (TD3-style): actors updated every 2 steps, critics every step
- Gradient clipping for stability
- Deterministic policy gradient for higher level
- Expected Q-value maximization for lower level (discrete actions)

**Impact:**
- Complete actor-critic training loop
- Proper policy improvement alongside value learning
- Better convergence and performance

---

### 8. **NEW** Enhanced Statistics Tracking
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Just Added!)

**Feature:** Added comprehensive tracking of training metrics:

#### New Metrics
- `avg_lower_critic_loss`: Lower-level Q-function learning
- `avg_higher_critic_loss`: Higher-level Q-function learning
- `avg_lower_actor_loss`: Lower-level policy improvement
- `avg_higher_actor_loss`: Higher-level policy improvement
- `avg_intrinsic_reward`: Average intrinsic reward magnitude
- `avg_extrinsic_reward`: Average environment reward
- `intrinsic_extrinsic_ratio`: Ratio of intrinsic to extrinsic rewards

**Impact:**
- Better visibility into hierarchy health
- Can monitor if intrinsic rewards dominate
- Track both value and policy learning progress
