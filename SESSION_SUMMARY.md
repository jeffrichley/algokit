**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Version**: v0.13.1 → v0.14.0 → v0.14.1
**Duration**: Full session
**Status**: ✅ Highly Productive!

## 🏆 Major Accomplishments

### 1. 🧪 HIRO Test Coverage Improvement
**Impact**: Critical quality improvement
**Result**: 50% → 99% coverage

**Details**:
- Created 17 new comprehensive tests (31 → 48 total)
- Added edge case tests for exploration and statistics
- Added training method tests (critics & actors, both levels)
- Added episode training integration tests
- Created mock environments for testing

**Files**:
- `tests/hierarchical_rl/test_hiro.py` (+474 lines)
- `HIRO_COVERAGE_IMPROVEMENT.md` (documentation)

**Coverage**: Only 3 lines uncovered (99% achievement!)

---

### 2. 📚 Algorithm Family Documentation
**Impact**: Major documentation improvement
**Result**: 1,344 lines of educational content

**Created**:
- `docs/dynamic-programming/overview.md` (235 lines)
- `docs/algorithms/reinforcement-learning/overview.md` (347 lines)
- `docs/algorithms/hierarchical-rl/overview.md` (362 lines)
- `docs/algorithms/pathfinding/overview.md` (400 lines)

**Content**: Each page includes:
- Core concepts and principles

- When to use each approach
- Problem-solving strategies
- Learning paths (beginner → advanced)
- Code examples
- Further reading resources

**Files**:
- `ALGORITHM_FAMILY_DOCS_SUMMARY.md` (documentation)

---

### 3. 🔧 Unified CI/CD Workflow
**Impact**: Critical infrastructure improvement
**Result**: Safe, coordinated pipeline

**Problem Solved**:
- Old workflows ran independently
- Version could bump even if tests failed
- No coordination between CI, docs, and releases

**Solution**:
- Created unified `main.yml` workflow
- Established proper job dependencies
- Quality gates → Docs build → Docs deploy → Version bump → Release

**Execution Order**:
```
Phase 1: Quality (lint, type, test) → must pass
Phase 2: Build Docs → must pass
Phase 3: Deploy Docs → must pass (main only)
Phase 4: Version Bump → creates tag (main only)
Phase 5: GitHub Release → auto-generated notes
Trigger: release.yml → PyPI publish
```

**Files**:
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` (254 lines, new unified workflow)
- `CI_WORKFLOW_REDESIGN.md` (documentation)
- Deleted: `ci.yml`, `commitizen.yml`, `deploy-docs.yml` (merged)

- `QUICK_STATUS.md` - Version, priorities, recent wins
- Updated to v0.14.0+ with current state

---

### 6. 🔤 Codespell Configuration
**Impact**: Better maintainability
**Result**: Centralized spell check exceptions

**Created**:
- `.codespellignore` file with:
  - Project names
  - Author names from academic papers
  - Technical acronyms
  - Well-documented with comments

**Benefits**:
