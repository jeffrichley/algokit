# Dynamic Programming Algorithms

## Overview

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic paradigm that solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. The key insight is that many problems have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, allowing us to store and reuse solutions to avoid redundant computation.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: The same subproblems are solved multiple times
- **Memoization/Tabulation**: Store solutions to avoid recalculating

**Common Applications:**
- Optimization problems (knapsack, coin change)
- Sequence problems (Fibonacci, longest common subsequence)
- Path finding and graph algorithms
- Resource allocation and scheduling
- Bioinformatics and string processing

## Key Concepts

- **Memoization (Top-Down)**: Store results of expensive function calls and return cached results
- **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**: Build solutions iteratively from base cases up to the target
- **State Transition**: Define how to move from one state to another
- **Base Cases**: Define solutions for the smallest subproblems
- **Recurrence Relation**: Mathematical formula that defines the problem in terms of subproblems
