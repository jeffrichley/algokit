# Planning Algorithms

## Overview
Planning algorithms solve the problem of finding a sequence of actions to achieve a goal state from an initial state. These algorithms are fundamental to artificial intelligence, robotics, and automated decision-making systems. Planning involves searching through a space of possible states and actions to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.

## Key Concepts
- **State Space**: The set of all possible states the system can be in
- **Action Space**: The set of all possible actions that can be taken
- **Goal State**: The desired final state to be achieved
- **Path Planning**: Finding a sequence of actions from start to goal
- **Optimality**: Finding the shortest or most efficient path
- **Completeness**: Guaranteeing a solution will be found if one exists

## Comparison Table
| Algorithm | Complexity | Strengths | Weaknesses | Applications |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| A* Search | O(b^d) | Optimal, efficient with good heuristic | Memory intensive for large spaces | Pathfinding, game AI, robotics |
| GraphPlan | O(n^2) | Handles complex constraints, parallel actions | Limited to propositional logic | Automated planning, logistics |
| Partial Order Planning | O(n!) | Flexible execution order, handles uncertainty | Can be computationally expensive | Project management, workflow design |
| Fast Forward | O(n^2) | Fast for many domains, good heuristic | Not guaranteed optimal | Automated planning, scheduling |
