# MPC Algorithms

## Overview

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an advanced control strategy that uses a mathematical model of the system to predict future behavior and optimize control actions over a finite prediction horizon. The controller solves an optimization problem at each time step to determine the optimal control sequence, applies the first control action, and then repeats the process in a receding horizon fashion.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Predictive Capability**: Uses system model to predict future behavior
- **Constraint Handling**: Naturally incorporates input, state, and output constraints
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balances tracking performance and control effort
- **Receding Horizon**: Continuously updates control strategy
- **Model-Based**: Requires accurate system model for good performance

**Common Applications:**
- Industrial process control
- Automotive and aerospace systems
- Robotics and automation
- Power systems and smart grids
- Chemical and manufacturing processes

## Key Concepts

- **Prediction Horizon**: Number of future time steps used for prediction
- **Control Horizon**: Number of control inputs to optimize
- **Receding Horizon**: Strategy of applying first control and shifting horizon
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Ensuring all operational constraints are met
- **Optimization**: Solving for optimal control sequence at each time step
- **Model Accuracy**: Dependence on system model quality for performance
