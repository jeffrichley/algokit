# Real-Time Control Algorithms

## Overview
Real-Time Control algorithms are designed to operate within strict timing constraints, making decisions and executing control actions in real-time. These algorithms are essential for systems that must respond quickly to changing conditions, such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and robotic systems. Real-time control emphasizes computational efficiency, predictable performance, and robust operation under time pressure.

## Key Concepts
- **Real-Time Constraints**: Strict deadlines for control computations and actions
- **Deterministic Performance**: Predictable and consistent execution times
- **Latency Management**: Minimizing delays between sensing and actuation
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimizing computational and memory usage
- **Fault Tolerance**: Maintaining operation despite system failures
- **Predictable Behavior**: Consistent response times under varying loads
