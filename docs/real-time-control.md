# Real-Time Control

Implement fast, reactive control systems with feedback.

## Algorithms

### PID Controller (P/PI/PD/PID)
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

### Bang-bang Control
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

### Kalman Filter
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

## Concepts

- Feedback vs feedforward
- Tuning gains
- Real-time latency constraints
