# Real-Time Control

Implement fast, reactive control systems that rely on continuous feedback. These methods keep robots and embedded systems stable under tight latency constraints.

## Algorithms

### PID Controller (P/PI/PD/PID)
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

### Bang-bang Control
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

### Kalman Filter
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

## Concepts

- Feedback vs feedforward
- Tuning gains
- Real-time latency constraints
