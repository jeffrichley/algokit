# Linear Model Predictive Control

!!! info "ðŸš§ Coming Soon"
    This algorithm is currently in development and will be available soon.

**Family:** [Model Predictive Control](index.md)

## Overview

Linear MPC uses linear system models to predict future behavior and optimize control actions. It's computationally efficient and widely used in process control applications.

## Planned Implementation

This algorithm is scheduled for implementation with the following features:

## Mathematical Formulation

**Objective:** `min Î£(k=0 to N-1) [||x(k)||Â²_Q + ||u(k)||Â²_R]`
