# Dynamic Movement Primitives

Encode reusable motion trajectories as stable dynamical systems. Dynamic movement primitives let robots reproduce and adapt motions learned from demonstrations.

## Algorithms

### DMP Encoding/Decoding
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

### Imitation Learning Using DMPs
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

## Concepts

- Nonlinear dynamical systems
- Attractor landscapes
- Temporal scaling
