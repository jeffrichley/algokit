## Quick Start

Get up and running with Algorithm Kit in minutes:

- **Install**: `uv pip install -e .` (editable development install)
- **Test**: `just test` (run the test suite)
- **Lint**: `just lint` (check code quality)

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    # Install in editable mode
    uv pip install -e .

    # Run tests
    just test

    # Check code quality
    just lint
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # Import the package
    import algokit

    # Your algorithm implementations here
    print("Algorithm Kit is ready!")
    ```
