## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Algorithm Kit seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [jeffrichley@gmail.com](mailto:jeffrichley@gmail.com).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.
