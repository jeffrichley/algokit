# Model Predictive Control

Use constrained optimization to plan control actions over a moving horizon. Model predictive control balances performance with constraint satisfaction in process control and robotics.

## Algorithms

### Finite Horizon MPC
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

### Nonlinear MPC
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

### Learning-based MPC
TODO: Implementation forthcoming.

## Concepts

- Cost functions
- State and control constraints
- Receding horizon optimization
