# PID Control

!!! info "ðŸš§ Coming Soon"
    This algorithm is currently in development and will be available soon.

**Family:** [Control Systems](index.md)

## Overview

PID control is one of the most widely used control algorithms in industry. It combines three control actions: proportional (P), integral (I), and derivative (D) to achieve stable and accurate control of dynamic systems.

## Planned Implementation

This algorithm is scheduled for implementation with the following features:

## Mathematical Formulation

**Control Law:** `u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i âˆ«e(Ï„)dÏ„ + K_d de(t)/dt`

**Parameters:**
- `K_p: proportional gain`
- `K_i: integral gain`
- `K_d: derivative gain`

## Expected Complexity

- **Time:** $O(1)$
- **Space:** $O(1)$
- **Notes:** Constant time per control step

## Applications

- Industrial automation
- Robotics
- Process control
- Automotive systems
