# Adaptive Control

!!! info "ðŸš§ Coming Soon"
    This algorithm is currently in development and will be available soon.

**Family:** [Control Systems](index.md)

## Overview

Adaptive control systems automatically adjust their control parameters to maintain optimal performance as system dynamics change. This is particularly useful for systems with uncertain or time-varying parameters.

## Planned Implementation

This algorithm is scheduled for implementation with the following features:

## Mathematical Formulation

**Parameter Update:** `Î¸(t+1) = Î¸(t) + Î³ Ï†(t) e(t)`

**Parameters:**
- `Î³: adaptation gain`
- `Ï†(t): regressor vector`
- `e(t): tracking error`

## Expected Complexity

- **Time:** $O(n^2)$
- **Space:** $O(n)$
- **Notes:** n = number of parameters

## Applications

- Aerospace systems
- Robotics
- Process control
- Autonomous vehicles
