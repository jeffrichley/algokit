# Fibonacci Sequence

!!! info "ðŸš§ Coming Soon"
    This algorithm is currently in development and will be available soon.

**Family:** [Dynamic Programming](index.md)

## Overview

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that demonstrates the power of dynamic programming. The sequence is defined as: each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

## Planned Implementation

This algorithm is scheduled for implementation with the following features:

## Mathematical Formulation

**Recurrence Relation:** `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1`

**Base Cases:** `F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1`

**Closed Form:** `Binet's formula available`

## Expected Complexity

- **Time:** $O(n)$
- **Space:** $O(1)$
- **Notes:** Linear time with constant space using iterative approach

## Applications

- Learning DP concepts
- Mathematical sequences
- Educational examples
