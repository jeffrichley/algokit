## 📝 Test Organization

Tests are organized into clear categories following project standards:

1. **Configuration Tests** (`TestHIROConfig`) - 17 tests
2. **Initialization Tests** (`TestHIROAgentInitialization`) - 6 tests
3. **Functionality Tests** (`TestHIROAgentFunctionality`) - 6 tests
4. **Policy Network Tests** (`TestHIROPolicyNetworks`) - 4 tests
5. **Edge Case Tests** (`TestHIROAgentEdgeCases`) - 3 tests
6. **Training Method Tests** (`TestHIROTrainingMethods`) - 8 tests
7. **Episode Training Tests** (`TestHIROEpisodeTraining`) - 6 tests

## 🔍 Remaining Uncovered Lines

Only 3 lines remain uncovered (minor edge cases):

1. **Line 790:** Fallback when `goal_state` or `current_goal` is None
   ```python
   else:
       intrinsic = 0.0
   ```

2. **Line 857:** Conditional loss tracking (higher critic)
   ```python
   if higher_critic_loss > 0:
   ```

3. **Line 867:** Conditional loss tracking (higher actor)
   ```python
   if higher_actor_loss > 0:
   ```

These are extremely minor conditional branches that occur rarely in practice.

## ✨ Key Testing Improvements

### Mock Environments
Created simple, focused mock environments for testing:
- `SimpleEnv` - Basic environment for core functionality
- `OldStyleEnv` - Tests backward compatibility
- `LongerEnv` - Tests extended training scenarios

### Test Patterns Used
- ✅ **Arrange-Act-Assert** structure throughout
- ✅ Explicit `@pytest.mark.unit` decorators
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings for each test
- ✅ Type hints on all test functions
- ✅ Clear, descriptive test names

### Coverage of Critical Paths
- ✅ All training methods (critic and actor, both levels)
- ✅ Goal selection and action selection
- ✅ Goal relabeling and hindsight experience
- ✅ Intrinsic reward computation
- ✅ Target network updates
- ✅ Experience buffer management
- ✅ Full episode training loops

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

To achieve 100% coverage, could add:
1. Test that explicitly forces `goal_state = None` during episode step
2. Test with specific seeds that guarantee positive loss values in tracking conditions

However, 99% coverage with comprehensive functional testing is excellent! 🎉
